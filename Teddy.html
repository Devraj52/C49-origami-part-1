            <li>In 1902 in Germany, Steiff launched “Bear 55 PB”, the first toy bear with jointed arms and legs. </li>
            <li>The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.</li>
            <li>The Teddy Bears’ Picnic song was originally called The Teddy Bear Two Step. </li>
            <li>It was composed in 1907 by JK Bratton. Its words by Jimmy Kennedy were added in 1932. </li>
            <li>Bear hugs predate teddy bears by 60 years. The term bear-hug was first recorded in 1846.</li>
            <li>Washable teddy bears didn't appear until 1954 when the stuffing was switched to an easier to clean nylon fill. Before that, they were stuffed with mohair, wool, and other hard to clean fills.</li>
            <li>The official term for a teddy bear collector is an ‘arctophile’.</li>
