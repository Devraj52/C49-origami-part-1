            Some interesting facts about chameleons.
        </u></h2>
        <h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chameleons have extremely powerful tongues.</li>
            <li>Excluding their tail, some chameleons’ tongues can be twice the length of their body. Their tongues consist of both muscles and bones, and can bend round to grab their pray.</li>
            <li>Others may be a little more carnivorous, and feast on small birds and even other, smaller chameleons.</li>
            <li>Most chameleons like to set up camp in trees, and as such are highly developed to traverse trunks and branches.</li>
            <li>Like most animals, male and female chameleons look differently. Though not particularly social animals, males usually have horns and spikes, while females don’t.</li>
            <li>Chameleons’ eyesight has developed both to help them catch prey and, as we’ve seen, to help them escape predators. They can focus their eyes relatively well, meaning they can judge distances and spot prey between 5 and 10 metres.</li>
            <li>Generally, chameleons don’t live very long – some for up to 10 years in captivity, with some dying after as few as 2. Most will live longer in the wild, though perhaps not by very much. Poor chameleons!</li>
        </ul>
